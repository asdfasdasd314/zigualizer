# Math Stuff
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors

# Rendering Stuff
- Camera options
    - Fixing in place
        - Object creation menu
- Render an object and its projection
- Animation

# Clean Up
- Create solid documentation for math functions
- Figure out how to move tests in dedicated test files and not have to keep all in one big file
    - Will involve necessary alterations to `build.zig`
- Clean up unnecessary errors
